# Project - HaHu
### *Data analysis hobby project built on Python and SQL*

The underlying concept of the project derived from my fellow classmate and highschoolfriend (and a very promising "Pythoner") @geriski, both of us were tired of our current career path, and wished for something more promising. Data analysis was a topic of interest amongst us, we decided to start a joint hobbyproject after reading an introduction book to Python (Python Crash Course by Eric Matthews, I'm strongly recommeneding for everyone who starts without any prior programming knowledge, just like I did). The book's challenges and tasks generated significant enthusiasm towards the topic, so following @geriski's suggestion we've tried to analyze the **secondhand car market** of Hungary. üßê

This repository is the third version of the original concept, with every version it's significantly evolved and improved, the only drawback is the 50% fall back in the number of the contributors. üòî

#### The project consists of three main phases:
- [X] 1) Collecting the data 
- [ ] 2) Descriptive Analytics
- [ ] 3) Predictive Analytics

## Phase 1 - Collecting the dataset
The desired dataset is based on the country's biggest used car offer site: [hasznaltauto.hu](https://www.hasznaltauto.hu), the key challenges were the 
* selection of advertisements 
* finding the valuable bits of information within the raw data
* storing the data efficiently and effectively
